    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        In June 2017, the aging <abbr title="Microsoft Developer Network">MSDN</abbr> subscriber portal was "taken offline", with the new Visual Studio Subcription portal only being accessible to subscribers.
        The old portal was finally completely retired in October 2017, leaving many to wonder where to get information to verify digitally-delivered Microsoft products without a subscription.
        This project aims to preserve the once publicly available MSDN hashes for reference purposes and make them easier to search with just the SHA-1 hash.

        This site uses externally scraped data, which is updated on an ad-hoc basis.
        There will be a delay between when new files are released by Microsoft before they show up here.<br/>
        Additionally, there are certain fields that are not easily filterable with the provided data, e.g. architecture (x86/x64).
