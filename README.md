msdnhash
=============
In June 2017, the MSDN subscriber portal was "taken offline", with the new Visual Studio sub portal only being open to subscribers.
While the old portal still works after a few DOM changes, it's not guaranteed how long it will stay up.
This project aims to preserve MSDN hashes for reference purposes.

### Instructions
Copy `settings_private.example.py` to `settings_private.py` and put your configuration in there.
